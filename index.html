                <p class="bio"> Hello everyone, my name is Zhanna. I was born in Moscow, Russia and raised in Colorado. My family has lived here for over twenty years, so Colorado has always been home to me. I am Armenian and I speak Russian fluently. Last year I graduated from the University of Colorado-Denver, where I studied Business Administration with an emphasis in Management and Human Resources. I currently work at Sephora inside JCPenney as an Operations Consultant and have been working there for about three years. </p>

                    <p class="bio2">I love all things involving art and creativity. After working at Sephora for a while and learning various artistry skills, I began doing freelance makeup artistry for events and photoshoots. Doing makeup for photoshoots is one of my passions and my favorite hobby. Earlier this year, the makeup I did for a photoshoot was published in a magazine, which was really cool! Aside from makeup, a few of my other loves include food, tv shows, movies, and music.</p>
